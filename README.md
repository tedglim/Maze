This is a prototype for 2d tile-based grid movement.
For path navigation, I used A* pathfinding with heuristics that minimizes turns and makes paths closer to the end cost less.

People can use this to make their own maze, simulate how A* explores their maze, and then have a unit take the path that A* generates from the "Start" tile to the "End" tile.
